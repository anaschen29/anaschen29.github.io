Below are some of the common questions. Of course, you can always ask the TAs or us instructors any questions you have via Office Hours and Piazza. If it is a private or serious matter, please email the [faculty mailing list at nlp-staff-fa23@mit.edu](mailto:nlp-staff-fa23@mit.edu).

## ENROLLMENT
- **Can I audit the course?** Sure! However, since the course is large and we are resource-contrained by only having 10 TAs, we will not grade any auditing students' assignments.

## ACCESS
- **Are lectures in-person or on Zoom?** This semester, lectures are fully in-person. They are also recorded and will be published on Canvas within a few days after the lecture. We highly encourage and recommend everyone to attend lecture. Let's create an enriching, fun environment.
 
## ASSIGNMENTS
- **Can I work with others on homework?** No. Homework assignments are to be completed individually and not with others. To be clear, we encourage you to talk and discuss the assignments with your fellow students, but this should be at the _conceptual_ level. That is, <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">no student should ever see another student's solutions or code. If you post or share your homework assignment online (even if it only contains the questions and not solutions), this violates our academic policy and you will be reported to the university. This includes posting your assignment on GitHub. Do not do this.</span> In other words, your homework assignment is a private copy that only you should see. If you're unsure if something is allowed, please speak with us first. See the [syllabus](syllabus) for more details.

- **I submitted my homework a few minutes late, can I still get credit?** Yes. Homework assignments are due on select <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Mondays at 11:59pm</span>. Anytime after this is considered late. No exceptions. Your fellow classmates work hard to turn in assignments on time, so although we wish we could be lenient on the submission time, we have to draw the line somewhere (so we do at 11:59pm). It would be unfair to your classmates if we made exceptions. The good news is that every student is allowed **three free late days** without any penalty. See the [syllabus](syllabus) for more details.

- **I turned in an assignment late and wish to use one of my free late days. What do I need to do?** Nothing at all. We will track all late days in the order in which you use them. See the [syllabus](syllabus) for more details.
