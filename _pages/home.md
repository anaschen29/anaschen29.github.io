## OVERVIEW
Welcome to 6.S096! We are excited to have you in class this IAP. 


### DESCRIPTION
Many applications in cryptography and theoretical computer science rely on number theory, which is often not taught in introductory classes. In this class, we try to teach these concepts. We begin with a quick review of the basics: Euclidean algorithm and modular arithmetic. We will then cover multiplicative modular arithmetic (Euler, Fermat), elements of group theory, the discrete logarithm problem, and elementary analytic number theory if time permits. There will be a focus on computational methods as well, using Sage and other Computer Algebra Systems.

The assessments will consist of weekly homeworks with a small final project. The expectation is that students have taken 6.042/6.1200 or a class at a similar level in discrete mathematics, as well as some coding experience.

## ENROLLMENT
Please pre-register! The class is offered as a U/G class and will be graded on a P/F basis. 

### PREREQUISITES 
For 6.S096, you need experience and skill with mathematical concepts, theorems, and proofs.  If you did well in 18.062/6.042, 18.200, 18.090, or any proof-oriented mathematics class, you should be fine! Some exposure to elementary number theory (modular arithmetic) and programming (e.g. Python) is also strongly recommended but not required. We also  _based on 18.404's recommended background_

### COURSE NAME
We acknowledge that "Number Theory - All you need to know" is for publicity. A better should hopefully be "Number Theory - All you need to know to be more interested", or "Number Theory for CS Crash Course".
