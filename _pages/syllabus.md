## INTRODUCTION
Welcome to <font color="#3778AE">6.S096</font>!

While we may not see it, the vast field of number theory is all around us. From the cryptosystems that enable secure communications to applications in scheduling, number theory is a vast area of mathematics which we're passionate about, and we'd like to share that passion with you. 


## LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of the course, you will be able to:
- master the basics of modular arithmetic
- express the elementary results of modular arithmetic in the language of groups. 
- tackle your own, novel goals with text data once this course is over (e.g., if you have downloaded thousands of tweets over the past week, you’ll be able to come up with reasonable solutions to (1) identify sentiments about any phrase; (2) make classification predictions; (3) identify aliases for any entity, and much more)


## PREREQUISITES
- **Number Theory**: No previous experience required, but modular aithmetic strongly encouraged. 
- **Proof Writing**: Strong grasp of Proofs by induction, contradiction, etc... Similar to <font color="#31493C"><b>18.062/6.1200 (6.042)6</b></font> and <font color="#31493C"><b>18.090</b></font>. 
- **Programming**: knowledge of a programming language (esp. Python) recommended but not required.
## SOFTWARE
You will program using (a) **Python** and/or (b) **Sage**, extensively. We do not expect you to know Sage, but we do expect some familiarity with Python. If you are not already familiar with Python, you will be expected to learn a bit it on your own. 

## COURSE STRUCTURE
The main delivery of information will be via **Lectures** and **Problem Sets**. In lecture, we will cover important foundations and some results, which will be cemented and complemented through **Problem Sets**. There will be additional readings and/or pre-recorded lectures before the course begins so everyone is up to date on the same content. 

### LECTURES


Starting January 15: 
We will operate an inverted model for a week, with pre-recorded lectures/notes released, and then three two-hour problem solving sessions. 
- Problem Session 1 (Monday January 15): Modular Arithmetic
- Problem Session 2 (Wednesday January 17): Euler and Fermat's Theorems
- Problem Session 3 (Thursday January 18): More Elementary Number Theory

Starting January 22: 
We will have lectures on Monday, Wednesday, Thursday

- Lecture 1: Quadratic Residues, Primitive Roots
- Lecture 2: Group Theory; with a focus on the previous content and Elliptic Curves
- Lecture 3: Integers, Prime Numbers, and More. 
- Lecture 4: Introduction to Cryptography
- Lecture 5: Diophantine Equations
- Lecture 6: Wrap Up: Results in Theoretical Computer Science. 


### <font color="#5B90E0">HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENTS (30%)</font>
There will be approximately four homework assignments. The schedule will be posted later. 


## RESOURCES
**To be completed.**
- [Emergency Helpline](mailto:6.s096-iap24-staff@mit.edu): for private concerns, issues, and questions (not course-content related).  
- [Supplemental Resources](supplemental): a compilation of useful, external resources

## HELP
Students are encouraged to consistently read lecture notes and actively participate in discussions (**Piazza**) This is intended to be a shared learning environment for all students in the class. 

Teaching Staff will hold scheduled **Office Hours** throughout every week. They will be fun, interactive time to ask questions. 

## COURSE POLICIES
### COLLABORATION POLICY
<!-- <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"><b>The homework assignments must be conducted individually.</b></span> However, no single student should feel alone in the course. So, we encourage you to talk with and discuss the assignments with your fellow classmates, but this must be at the _conceptual_ level. That is, <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">no student should ever see another student's solutions or code. Your code must be written exclusively by you. If you post or share your homework assignment online (even if it only contains the questions and not solutions), this violates our academic policy and you will be reported to the university. This includes posting your assignment on GitHub. Do not do this.</span> In other words, your homework assignment is a private copy that only you can see. If you're unsure if something is allowed, please speak with us first. Any violation to the above constitutes Academic Dishonesty and will be reported. -->
<!--   
We discourage you from using publicly-available code online, as you'll learn more if you write your code from scratch. However, **if you find useful code online that you wish to use, that is perfectly fine, but you must cite it.**

**We do not allow using Generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot, etc). Evidence of such will voilate our academic pollicy.**

As a reminder, if a student cheats, it is not only harmful to one's own education but it also impacts everyone else in the course -- as it creates an unfair environment and sacrifices the integrity of the entire course. For this reason, we actively check to ensure your code hasn't been plagiarized or posted online. -->
  
### ACADEMIC HONESTY
Ethical behavior is an important trait of anyone who works in the fields of Computer Science, Machine Learning, Data Science, NLP -- from ethically handling data, to thinking of the ramifications of one’s models, to attribution of code and work of others. Thus, in this course, we place strong emphasis on Academic Honesty.

### COMMUNICATION FROM STAFF TO STUDENTS
Class announcements will be through this website, and through mailing.
